// This file contains no code, but does seem like the logical place
// to talk about how this module works.

// Any page can have a status block put onto it. It will render messages
// put into it in the following form.

// It will clear itself everytime the path changes. That means if you want
// to pass a message when redirecting page you'll need to set the message post
// changing URL.

// Currently index.js is clearing the message between loads.
